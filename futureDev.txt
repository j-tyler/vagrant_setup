- Modularize syncing function as to let user turn on/off network sync.
  This lets the base script be used as a simple Vagrant box setup

- Build Google Drive sync.  This will be much more reliable than the local
  network drives users don't have capalibity to access or fix when broken.

- Rsync is not a good tool for multi-way syncing. There is no robustness for
  when a sync failed either to the network or from the network. This can cause
  lost data. Not good.
